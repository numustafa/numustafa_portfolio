# [Project 2: Housing Prices Regression Model](https://github.com/numustafa/housing_project) 
For this project, I followed the workflow of KenJee. This project helps me expands my knowledgebase in Machine Learning application. 
* Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis for large no of features in the data
* Saperate data pipelines, ensuring NaN's and missing values make significant impact in out ML models.
* Applied ML models with Grid Search to find the optimum model.
* Applied PCA, to reduce dimensionality of the data
* Feature Engineering for different variables.
* Checked ML models for Lowest RMSE after PCA & Feature Engineering
* Applied Stacking Ensamble Learning model with 3 fold validation on Neural Net, XG Boost and Linear Regression
* Generate Output files

# [Project 3: Models in Biological Neural Network](https://github.com/numustafa/Biological-Neural-Networks) 
For this project, I followed the exercises described by the project. The exercises were based on the paper, I presented in my seminar. 

Skills presented: *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *Python Libraries*, *Report Writing*, *Mathematics*, *Code Interpretation*, *Theory*

# [Project 4: QR Detection](https://github.com/numustafa/Computer-Vision-1/tree/main/Assignment1) 
For this project, I followed the exercises described by the OpenCV course.  
* Skills presented: *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *OpenCV*, *Code Interpretation*

# [Project 5: ChatBox with ChatGPT API](https://github.com/numustafa/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/blob/main/dl_prompt_eng/chat_box.ipynb) 
For this project, I followed the exercises described by the deeplearning.ai course.  
* Skills presented: *Python programming*, *API*, *ChatGPT*

# [Project 6: Building an Image Classifier with CNN](https://github.com/numustafa/Image-Classifier-using-CNN)
For this project, I used my learnings from the ongoing [Deep Learning with Tensorflow and keras](https://opencv.org/university/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-keras/) course. The project elaborates:
* Applying Modular coding practice
* Using colab and its embedded functions to download and unzip image data
* Handelling large amount of Image Data
* Visualization of random images and model results
* Creating Batch Dataset objects of image data
* Train a deep Neural Network, using Keras Functional API. The model includes 4 convolution Layers with max pooling, Flatten Layer, Dense layer and output layer with softmax activation.
* Model interpretation & visualization
* Applying Data Augmentation Techeniques like; rotation, zoom and horizontal flip, to improve model accuracy.
* Evaluate the model on test dataset, and showed improved accuracy.
* Code Explaination.
