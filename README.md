# NUMustafa_Portfolio
My work on building ML Pipelines, Data Pipelines and LLM Applications

# [Project 1: Kaggle Titanic Project](https://github.com/numustafa/titanic_project) 
* Applied Data Analysis Tools, such as Data Cleaning, Data preprocessing, model building and Model Tunnning
* Datailed the report on processes which are applied
* Applied Supervised Machine learning techeniques  
* Optimized Classifiers using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Used Ensamble approach to find optimum classifier
* Submitted outpur in a Dataframe
  
Skills presented: *Data Analysis*, *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *Python Libraries*, *ML Pipelines*, *Kaggle Competition*, *Report Writing*


# [Project 2: Housing Prices Regression Model](https://github.com/numustafa/housing_project) 
For this project, I followed the workflow of KenJee. This project helps me expands my knowledgebase in Machine Learning application. 
* Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis for large no of features in the data
* Saperate data pipelines, ensuring NaN's and missing values make significant impact in out ML models.
* Applied ML models with Grid Search to find the optimum model.
* Applied PCA, to reduce dimensionality of the data
* Feature Engineering for different variables.
* Checked ML models for Lowest RMSE after PCA & Feature Engineering
* Applied Stacking Ensamble Learning model with 3 fold validation on Neural Net, XG Boost and Linear Regression
* Generate Output files
Skills presented: *Data Analysis*, *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *Python Libraries*, *ML Pipelines*, *Kaggle Competition*, *Report Writing*
