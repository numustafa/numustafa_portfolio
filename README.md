# NUMustafa_Portfolio
My work on building ML Pipelines, Data Pipelines and LLM Applications

# [Project 1: Kaggle Titanic Project](https://github.com/numustafa/titanic_project) 
* Applied Data Analysis Tools, such as Data Cleaning, Data preprocessing, model building and Model Tunnning
* Datailed the report on processes which are applied
* Applied Supervised Machine learning techeniques  
* Optimized Classifiers using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Skills presented: *Data Analysis*, *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *Python Libraries*, *ML Pipelines*, *Kaggle Competition*, *Report Writing*


# [Project 2: Housing Prices Regression Model](https://github.com/numustafa/housing_project) 
For this project, I followed the workflow of KenJee. This project helps me expands my knowledgebase in Machine Learning application. 
* Skills presented: *Data Analysis*, *Python programming*, *Functional programming*, *Python Libraries*, *ML Pipelines*, *Kaggle Competition*, *Report Writing*
