# NUMustafa_Portfolio
My work on building ML Pipelines, Data Pipelines and LLM Applications

# [Project 1: Kaggle Titanic Project](https://github.com/numustafa/titanic_project) 
* Applied Data Analysis Tools, such as Data Cleaning, Data preprocessing, model building and Model Tunnning
* Datailed the report on processes which are applied
* Applied Supervised Machine learning techeniques  
* Optimized Classifiers using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.  


# [Project 2: Housing Prices Regression Model](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
